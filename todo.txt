"you wake up in some sort of ancient ruins. as you turn around, a large statue depicting some sort of deity looms over you, and a large pool of water resting at its feet, with a discarded weapon resting in the water. what is the weapon? [choose a weapon]"
"as you take the [weapon] into your hands, the water ripples beneath it. as you stare into it, someone stares back. who is it? [choose a class]"

Here are some fun and thematic ways for the player to gain skills throughout their run, allowing them to tailor their loadout and adapt to challenges as they progress. These methods keep the acquisition of new skills interesting, with each route offering distinct benefits and potential risks:
1. Shrines of Power
Description: Shrines dedicated to each Aspect and Class are scattered throughout the world. When visited, they allow the player to select a new skill or enhance an existing one.
Mechanic: Each shrine grants a skill from its respective Aspect or Class pool. Some shrines may also require a tribute, like a bit of HP or a consumable item, to activate the blessing.

2. Ancient Tomes and Scrolls
Description: Hidden in treasure chests or guarded by powerful foes, tomes and scrolls allow the player to learn skills. These can be found in the environment or looted from defeated enemies.
Mechanic: Tomes offer Aspect-based skills, while scrolls focus on Class-based skills. Once used, they are consumed, and the player can only hold a limited number at a time, encouraging careful decision-making.

3. Skill Trainers
Description: Friendly NPCs or mystical trainers who appear in safe zones or after certain boss battles. Each trainer specializes in a different skill category and offers unique abilities in exchange for currency or resources.
Mechanic: Trainers may charge various fees: in-game currency, stat sacrifices, or rare items. Some trainers appear randomly, and others are tied to specific locations, adding to the game’s sense of exploration.

4. Aspect Infusion Events
Description: Certain events allow players to “attune” themselves more deeply to their chosen Aspect, unlocking a skill specific to their Aspect.
Mechanic: Infusion events offer skill choices based on the player’s Aspect, potentially enhancing synergy with existing skills. Some events may present a choice between multiple skills or offer randomized skill rewards, depending on player decisions.

5. Enemy Mimicry
Description: After defeating powerful or unique enemies, the player may “absorb” or “mimic” one of their abilities temporarily.
Mechanic: This skill is only usable for a limited number of times or turns, adding a temporary but powerful boost. The player may encounter rare items or trainers that can make these mimicked skills permanent.

6. Skill Evolution Through Use
Description: Skills grow stronger or evolve when used frequently in combat, allowing the player to access more potent abilities over time.
Mechanic: Each skill has an experience bar, and upon maxing out, the player can select one of two “evolution” paths, adding new effects or increasing its power. This encourages players to invest in skills that align with their playstyle.

7. Artifacts of Skill
Description: Mystical artifacts or items, scattered in the world, come with embedded skills that the player can learn and master.
Mechanic: When equipped, the artifact provides a skill that the player can use temporarily. After a certain number of uses, the skill becomes permanently unlocked. This allows players to “try before they buy,” so to speak, when testing skills.

8. Soul Bonding
Description: Throughout the run, the player might come across ancient spirits or mythical creatures who offer skills in exchange for a bond.
Mechanic: Bonding with a spirit costs HP or temporary debuffs but grants powerful skills based on the creature’s characteristics (e.g., a fire spirit grants fire-based skills). Once bound, the spirit can also evolve with the player, granting access to enhanced skills.

9. Randomized Skill Totems
Description: Totems found within dungeons or temples contain randomized skills from different Aspects and Classes, providing a bit of risk-reward.
Mechanic: Totems generate random skills that the player can claim at the cost of HP or a temporary debuff. Some totems may also “curse” the skill slot, limiting the number of skills a player can hold, but offer rarer skills to make it worthwhile.

10. Memory Fragments
Description: Collectible memory fragments scattered through the run unlock skills tied to the player’s past, presenting personalized or narrative-driven abilities.
Mechanic: Each fragment grants a skill or enhances an existing one, giving a sense of progression tied to the player’s story. These fragments may be randomly located, incentivizing exploration.

11. Transmutation Chambers
Description: These special rooms allow the player to trade one or more of their skills for a new skill, randomly selected from a pool based on their current Aspect or Class.
Mechanic: The chamber “transmutes” sacrificed skills, giving a chance to experiment with different builds. Chambers are rare, but they can help the player adapt to new challenges.

12. Divine Blessings
Description: Players can occasionally find divine altars where they can pray to the Aspect-based deities, receiving a skill as a blessing.
Mechanic: Prayers require a small tribute, such as a portion of health or a temporary debuff. Blessings offer powerful skills that align with the Aspect and often come with bonus effects, such as healing when the skill is used.
